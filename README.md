# Gamebook

Welcome to Gamebook! The site where gaming enthusiasts can share thoughts, tips, tricks and more about games!
This site is designed to be a social media platform aimed specifically at gamers. It is a place where the community can come together and share a huge amount of knowledge on any game. The platform would also appeal to gaming companies and content creators as a way to advatise and monitor the popularity of certain games. This makes it stand out from the huge crowd of different social media platforms that exist today, and this is only the begining! I truely believe thise site could be improved apon significantly to make it even better with some extra features that would help it to excel in a real world senerio.

## The Frontend Development

- While it is crusial that the back end is functional, the main focus for this project was the front end. Front end developers often focus on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to create an interactive and user friendly application. This is what I tried to accomplish in this project, using wireframes to translate my ideas into a responsive and functioning website.

## New Updates!

*(1/11/2023)*
- **Contact:** A Contact form with a custom model created on separate page that users can navigate to using the navbar Contact link. Allows the user the submit a titled message to the backend where admin can recieve it.
- **Notifications:** Added React Notifications to give certain alerts to users. See Technologies and Testing for more.

#### Note all of these are also included below.

## The Wireframe

These wireframe were some basic ideas of how I wanted my site to look. I waanted it to be clear and practical, so that the user can navigate easily. I thought about putting the popular profiles section at the top of the page just under the navbar but I really wanted users to be able to see the first post clearly when they opened the site. This would be more likely to draw people in. However I realised that this was perfect for smaller screen widths, as having two columns next to each other on a mobile device for example makes the content much too small.

- The wireframe for the home page:

![wireframe home page](/docs/wireframes/wfhome.jpg)

- The wrieframe for the post page. This is the page a user will see if they click on a post to view it individually:

![wireframe post page](/docs/wireframes//wfpost.jpg)

- The wireframe for the profile page: something I forgot to consider here at the time of planning was that if a user is signed in, and is viewing another users profile, they will also see the follow/ unfollow button for that profile.

## Design Features

- **Color Scheme:** 

The colour scheme for this site is red, white and a super dark blue thats almost black. When I started the project my first thought was: 'What colours do I think of when I think about gaming?' and red was immediately my first response. The colour red is used so much in the gaming industry because of its vibrant, exciting appearance to make games amoung other products look as fun and exciting as possible. My next choice was black as black and red is used a lot in games, gaming equipment is commonly black. However when I tried to use black I didn't like the outcome. If I used it as a background colour it made the site look very dark, and a lot of the images I was uploading just didn't stand out so well on a black background. The more I lightened the black colour to more of a gray the less clear the red text became. I ended up using white instead as it looked a lot more friendly and welcoming which is something I wanted for my social media platform to encourage people to use it. However when I was experimenting with different shades of black I found this very nice black/blue which I decided to use as a highlight for things like the navbar icons when hovered or active. It stands out very well and contrasts nicely from the other colours which is perfect for this role.

- **Font:** 

My font which I chose for this site is called Roboto Mono and I really like how it is clear and easy to read it is. It also looks like a font from a video game; it reminds me of a font from a retro game but with a modern twist. I ended up using this font for the whole site as I thought it worked so well with the theme and kept the site consistent in style.

## Structural Features

## Future Features

In the future I would love to include the following aspects to make the site compete with other big social media platforms:

- Private messaging -to allow direct communication between users

- Pin comments -to allow only the owner of a post to pin a comment to the top of the list. It could be one they thought was most useful like an answer to a question, or one they thought was simply the most funny. This would improve user experience as other people looking for an answer wouldn't have to scroll through all comments to find it.

- Reply to comments -being able to reply to a specific comment would make communication between users easier as the reply would be under the original comment and not above in order from newest to oldest. It would be easier to tell who was talking to who or responding to which comment.

- Like comments -being able to like comments is similar to being able to pin them, except its not just the owner of the post who can like its comments. Allowing all suers to like comments (provided that they are logged in) provides more overall user interaction for the community.

- Email authentication / password recovery -to allow users to reset their password if they forgot it would be ideal for real world use. Everyone forgets their password sometimes! It would encorage users to continue using the site instead of giving up or having to make a new account.

- Emojis for desktop -emojis are a huge part of how people express themselves online and would not only improve user experince but also just make posting and communiting with each other more fun!

- Notifications -recieving notifications when someone likes of comments on your post would also encorage users to return to the site often and boost user activity.

- Able to view followers/following -being able to see a list of followers or people you are following would make it easier to follow/unfollow speific people so the user doesn't have to scroll through the feed to try to find someone.

## Reusable React Components

Using the Frontend JavaScript library React, I was able to combine reusable components to help create the user interface.
The components are created in separate files. These files are located in the components folder. This includes:

- Avatar.js
- Asset.js
- MoreDropDown.js
- NavBar.js
- NotFound.js

By creating them in separate files within the components folder the individual components can be imported where needed in the rest of the application.

**Avatar.js**

This is the users customizable, circular profile picture used to help them identify other users and distinguish them from themselves.

- Imported into the Profile.js file, so it can be displayed on the users profile page without having to rewrite the code for it there too.
- Imported into the NavBar.js file to display the users Avatar in the NavBar if logged in
- Imported into the Comment.js file to display the Avatar of the user who owns the comment
- Imported into the CommentCreateForm.js file so the user can see their Avatar when writting their comment
- Imported into the Post.js file so that users can see the post owner's Avatar


**Asset.js**

Essentially the Asset component does the same job in all these files, simply rendering a loading spinner when the application needs a second to search for a post or load a page.

- Imported into the NotFound.js file
- Imported into the PostCreateForm.js 
- Imported into the PostPage.js
- Imported into the PostsPage.js
- Imported into the PopularProfiles.js
- Imported into the ProfilePage.js


**MoreDropDown.js**

This component is a toggle drop down menu that can allow the user to edit and/or delete a comment, post and profile.

- Imported into the Comment.js
- Imported into the Post.js
- Imported into the ProfilePage.js


**NavBar.js**

The Navbar is imported into App.js to be used on the home page of the site. If more pages where to be added, like for example a market page where users could buy and sell pre-owned games, the navbar could be reused there. It would allow the user to navigate to and from that page seemlessly without the code being re-written. This is good practice as it would save time in the future.


**NotFound.js**

NotFound.js is imported into the App.js and is used to tell users when a page they are looking for is not found. This could be because of a misspelled or non-existant url typed by the user. 
As with NavBar.js it is only imported into one file, however it is easy to reuse this component elsewhere in the future.

## Bugs

### Major Bug:

- Bug: I added a 'Clips' feature to the site, with the idea that users could share clips with their followers on a separate 'Clips' page. I created the model and the JavaScript form for the clips, but the form doesn't seem to submit.

- Solution: Added a console log to the handleSubmit function to log the form content to the console when sumbitted. This did work and the entered values were logged, so the handleSubmit function is working but the form never seems to post to the Clips page. All of the URLs look correct so I'm not sure why this is.

- Outcome: **Unfixed** due to time limit. I have left all the code included in the project and will work on a fix after this project is graded. I commented out the navbar links to the clips page and create form so it cannot be accessed by users.


### Minor Bugs:

- Bug: The user could not see the stats on their profile/ another users profile such as number of posts, followers and following.

- Solution: In my serializers.py file inside the profiles directory I had forgotten to add 'posts_count', 'followers_count', 'following_count', to the fields lists in the meta class for the profile model.

- Outcome: **Fixed**

![bug example 1](/docs/screenshots/fix1.jpg)


- Bug: The user could not view individual posts or comment on posts. They would just be taken to a blank white screen.

- Solution: Correct the import in PostPage.js. I was importing from "react-router" when it should have been "react-router-dom".

- Outcome: **Fixed**

- I have tested my site using the devtools Lighthouse feature.

The results are not as good as I had hoped, with only 68 on performance due to a lot of images being loaded in the order they are posted by users.

## Deployment:

### Gitpod

- To run the site on port 8000: type 'cd frontend' into the terminal and then in a second terminal 'python3 manage.py runserver'. The will allow you to open the site on port 8000 where you can add '/admin' to the url andd access the Django Administration panel.
- To open a preview of the site on port 8080 (helpful when making changes that don't affect the deployed version unless pushed to Heroku): after the steps above, in the first terminal type 'npm start' and click open browser or preview in the pop up notification.
- Every time you change code you can save the file by pressing 'ctrl s', then the browser can be refreshed to see the change, sometimes you need to press ctrl + shift + R (hard reload) for changes to be updated.
- To save changes, type 'git add .' into a new, third terminal to add all your changes followed by 'git commit -m' and then your message describing what you did in double quotes directly after the 'm'.
- Typing 'git push' will then push your code, and this should be done at the end of every coding session or whenever you want an already deployed site to be updated.
- To allow changes to be visible on the deployed Heroku app the staticfiles folder will need to be updated. To do this simply run this command in the third terminal: 'npm run build && rm -rf ../staticfiles/build && mv build ../staticfiles/.' This essentially deletes the current staticfiles folder and creates a new one with all the changes. Then you will need to add/commit/push again, and redeploy the app in Heroku.

### ElephantSQL

- I used ElephantSQL to install the backend database. I had already set up an account so I could log in and begin.
- I clicked on the green 'Create New Instance' button in the top right.
- I added details such as name, region and the type of plan I wanted which was the free 'Tiny Turtle' plan.
- My database url was then provided for me to copy and paste into my config vars on Heroku and into my env.py file as an os environ variable.

### Cloudinary

- I used my existing Cloudinary account to host the images for this project. All I had to do was head to my profile and copy my personal 'API Environment variable' url to paste into the env.py file, and add to my config vars in the Heroku app settings.
- The command 'pip install django-cloudinary-storage' installs the library, and then it must be added to the 'Installed Apps' list in settings.py.
- The Cloudinary library also needs a 'CLOUDINARY_STORAGE' variable in the settings.py file that is set to the environment variable in env.py that is the 'API Environment variable' url.
- It also requires a MEDIA_URL in settings.py, the standard Django folder to store media files. This is set to '/media/' so the settings know where to put our image files.
- Lastly is the 'DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE' variable which is set to MediaCloudinaryStorage.

### Heroku

- For this project I deployed to Heroku at the begining of the project. Deploying early can save you a lot of time later on.
- To do this I created a new Heroku app which I named drfapi1 the same as the project in github.
- In the app settings I made sure to add all of the config vars I would need: the secret key, the port and my database url which I got from ElephantSQL.
- I made sure to comment out the old database 'db.sqlite3' in the settings.py file and added in my new database url.
- I also added my Heroku Hostname to the allowed hosts list.
- Back in Heroku I went to the deployment tab for my app and selected Github. Then I searched for and selected my repository.
- At the bottom of the page I ticked the box to enable automatic deploys, and then clicked deploy.
- To redeploy my site after updates I would repeat the last step above (click the deploy button at the bottom of the settings tab).
